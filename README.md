All documentation entries have the format JSON

An example is: 

```md
title: Name of the file
description: Description of the what's explained in this file

# Getting started

**Hello,**
Here we are! Here is the "Getting started" page!

## Commands

* ?help - Shows you the help list
* ?commands {module} - Shows you a list of all commands of a specific module
* ?website - Shows you all websites of LenoxBot

## Another example

Here you can see another example!
```

## What do I need to pay attention for?
- The title has to be the same as the name of the file
- The description should explain what's the content about
- All entries should be clear and understandable
