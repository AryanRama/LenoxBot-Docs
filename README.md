## What do I need to pay attention for?

- The title (that is on top of each Markdown file) has to be the same as the name of the file.
- The description (that is on top of each Markdown file) should not contain more than 30 words and explain what's the content about.
- All documentation entries should be clear and understandable
- Any newly created documentation entries must have the markdown format (.md at the end of the filename).

## What is Markdown (md)?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. (Source: Wikipedia)
If you don't know Markdown (md) well, this site can help you a lot: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
