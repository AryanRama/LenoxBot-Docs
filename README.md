All documentation entries have the format JSON

An example is: 

```json
{
    "title": "title",
    "author": "user#tag",
    "date": "DD/MM/YYYY",
    "content": "<p>content</p>"
}
```

## What do I need to pay attention for?
- In content, you have to put a \ in front of each "
- You also have to change the date if you update the Documentation entry
- In the content you have to use html tags! This site helps you much: https://www.onlinehtmleditor.net/ or our own website https://lenoxbot.com/editdocumentation
